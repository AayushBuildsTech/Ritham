# Ritham — Build Progress & Handoff Document

> **For Claude:** Read this entire file before doing anything. It is the single source of truth for what has been built, what decisions were made, and what to do next.

---

## 1. What Is Ritham

An AI-powered Vedic astrology Android app (React Native + Expo). Users create a profile with birth details → get a Kundli (birth chart) → chat with an AI astrologer anchored to their chart → buy time-based or question-based chat packs → read daily/weekly/monthly horoscopes → buy PDF reports (Vastu, Matchmaking) → browse an affiliate store.

**Target market:** Indian Android users. Payments via Razorpay (UPI/cards/wallets).

---

## 2. Tech Stack (Locked)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Mobile | React Native + Expo (managed), TypeScript |
| Routing | expo-router v4 (file-based) |
| Backend / DB / Auth | Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) |
| Payments | Razorpay (server-side order create + verify) |
| AI | Anthropic Claude API — **called only from Edge Functions, never client** |
| Kundli | Third-party API (Prokerala / VedicAstroAPI) behind `kundliService` module |
| Push notifications | **DROPPED for v1** — add after revenue |
| Analytics | Events table in Supabase |

---

## 3. Project Location

```
C:\Users\user\Desktop\Ritham\ritham\
```

This is the Expo project root. All commands must be run from this folder.

---

## 4. Current SDK Versions

```json
"expo": "~57.0.0",          // actual installed: 57.0.1
"react-native": "0.86.0",
"react": "19.2.3",
"expo-router": "~57.0.2",
"typescript": "~6.0.3"
```

**Why SDK 57:** We no longer use Expo Go (it crashed with the `PlatformConstants`
TurboModule error on the physical device). Instead we build a real dev client via
`npx expo run:android`, which removes the Expo-Go SDK ceiling — so the project was
consolidated onto the latest stable SDK (57), which `AGENTS.md` also targets.

**History:** The project was previously a broken mix — `expo@54` core with SDK-52
companion packages (RN 0.76, expo-router 4). That caused a Kotlin/KSP Gradle
failure. Fixed by `npx expo install expo@^57` then `npx expo install --fix`, then a
clean `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (React 19 peer strictness).

## 7. Packages Removed (Important — Do Not Re-add Without Care)

| Package | Why Removed |
|---|---|
| `react-native-gesture-handler` | Caused `PlatformConstants` TurboModule crash in Expo Go SDK 54 |
| `react-native-reanimated` | v4 requires `react-native-worklets` (missing); v3 babel plugin conflicted with babel-preset-expo in SDK 54 |
| `expo-secure-store` | Removed from plugins — was force-initializing a native module causing the crash. Also switched Supabase storage from SecureStore to AsyncStorage |

---

## 8. Testing Environment — RESOLVED ✅

Phase 1 now builds and runs on the physical device via `npx expo run:android`
(no Expo Go). The full local toolchain is set up and env vars are persisted:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Android SDK | `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` (API 36 platform, build-tools, platform-tools, NDK 27.1.12297006) |
| `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` | set to the SDK path (User env, persisted) |
| `ANDROID_SDK_HOME` | `C:\Android` (holds the adb auth key `.android\adbkey`) |
| `JAVA_HOME` | `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr` (bundled JDK 21) |
| adb | SDK `platform-tools\adb.exe` v37.0.0 |
| Device | OPPO/OnePlus **CPH2943**, serial `3K364W007HJ00000`, USB debugging ON |

**Gotchas that were fixed (don't reintroduce):**
- A stray `C:\Android\adb.exe` was on the **System** PATH and fought the SDK adb
  ("adb server is out of date" / device flapping to "unauthorized"). Those loose
  binaries were renamed to `*.bak`. Only the SDK adb should ever be used.
- Build must run with `JAVA_HOME` set to the Studio JBR, and `ANDROID_HOME` set.

### To run the app
```
cd C:\Users\user\Desktop\Ritham\ritham
npx expo run:android      # first build ~15-40 min (NDK + native compile); later builds ~1-3 min
```
First build downloads NDK 27 (~1 GB) and compiles native code (New Architecture is
default in SDK 57). Keep the phone unlocked/plugged in; accept any install prompt.

## 9. Build Phases — Status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Skeleton + Auth (Expo scaffold, 4-tab nav, Supabase OTP) | **DONE — verified on device** (OTP login → Home tab works) |
| 2 | Profile + Kundli (birth form, kundliService, chart storage) | **DONE — verified on device** (form + live geocoding + mock chart) |
| 3 | Chat — hero feature (free 1-min, countdown, AI via Edge Function) | **DONE — verified on device** (mock reply; add API key for real AI) |
| 4 | Payments + entitlements (Razorpay, ledger, paywall) | **DONE — verified on device** (card + netbanking payment → verify → entitlement granted → chat consumes; see §16) |
| 5 | Home horoscopes (cached, daily/weekly/monthly) | **DONE — verified on device** (migration + `horoscope` fn live; Moon-sign horoscope renders, mock text until API key; see §17) |
| 6 | Notifications | **DROPPED for v1** |
| 7 | Reports — premium branded PDF (Vastu + Matchmaking) — see §15 spec | Not started |
| 8 | Store (Amazon affiliate) | Not started |
| 9 | ~~Refer & Earn~~ | **REMOVED from plan** |
| 10 | Polish + compliance (privacy policy, disclaimer, analytics) | Not started |

> Note: Refer & Earn is dropped. The `referral_code` column + `generate_referral_code`
> trigger in migration 001 are now vestigial (harmless; leave as-is, optional cleanup later).

## 10. Non-Negotiable Rules (Remind Claude Every Phase)

1. All Kundli API calls go through `kundliService.getKundli(profile)` only — never direct
2. AI only narrates facts; never computes scores or chart placements
3. Payment always verified server-side in Edge Functions before granting entitlement
4. Cache horoscopes and Kundli summaries aggressively to protect margins
5. Free 1-min chat = one per verified phone number (not per profile)
6. All money stored in **paise (integer)** — display as ₹ in UI
7. Every paid entitlement has a ledger entry in `entitlements_ledger` table

---

---

## 14. What Claude Should Do Next Session

**Phases 1, 2, 3 + guided onboarding are DONE and verified on the device.** All code
is committed and pushed to GitHub (AayushBuildsTech/Ritham, branch `main`).

Two open follow-ups:

1. **Flip on real AI — DECISION: defer to near launch (~Phase 10).** The chat stays on
   the mock reply through development. When ready: add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Supabase
   → Edge Functions → `bright-processor` → Secrets (no code/deploy change — it swaps to
   real Claude Sonnet 5 automatically). At that point do a quality pass: send several
   real chats and tune the system prompt in `supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`. Do NOT
   prompt the user to add the key before then.
2. **Start Phase 4 — Payments + entitlements** (the money layer):
   - Razorpay: server-side order create + verify in an Edge Function (never trust the
     client — rule #3).
   - `entitlements_ledger` table: one row per paid grant (rule #7).
   - Turn the chat's "packs coming soon" banner into the real **paywall** using the
     session/question packs in `config/pricing.ts`.
   - Grant time-based / question-based entitlements after verified payment; consume
     them in the chat flow.
   - Decisions needed up front: Razorpay test keys, which packs to surface first.

**(Optional polish, not blocking):** `app/(auth)/index.tsx` + `verify-otp.tsx` still
dump the raw Supabase error as JSON — replace with friendly messages.

Per `AGENTS.md`, read the SDK 57 docs (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/)
before writing native/Expo code.

### Guided onboarding (new users)
Flow: **OTP → (auto) Kundli form → (auto) Home.** Chat is NOT part of onboarding —
it's a normal tab; the free 1-min is always available there.
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Home) redirects a signed-in user with NO profile to
  `/profile` (with a loading guard, no flash).
- `app/profile.tsx` — on FIRST profile creation (`wasNew`), `router.replace('/(tabs)')`
  (Home). Editing an existing profile still shows the chart view.
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` — normal tab behaviour; free minute available; when it ends
  it shows a banner and stays put (no auto-navigation).

### Phase 3 — Chat (working, mock AI)
- Edge Function is deployed on Supabase but the dashboard "Via Editor" flow
  auto-named it **`bright-processor`** (NOT `chat`). `lib/chatService.ts` calls that
  slug via the `CHAT_FUNCTION` constant — keep them in sync. Source lives at
  `supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`.
- Model chosen: **Claude Sonnet 5** (`claude-sonnet-5`), thinking disabled for snappy
  cheap chat replies. AI is called ONLY from the Edge Function.
- **Currently returns a MOCK reply** because `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` isn't set. To go
  live: Supabase → Edge Functions → (bright-processor) Secrets → add
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`. No redeploy/code change needed — the function
  swaps to real Claude automatically.
- Free 1-minute session = one per phone, enforced server-side via
  `users.free_minute_used_at`. To re-test the free flow, reset it:
  `update public.users set free_minute_used_at = null where phone = '<digits>';`
- Deploy note: local `npx supabase login`/`link` failed on Windows (device_code bug
  + path error). Dashboard "Via Editor" deploy was used instead — that's the
  reliable path here.

### Auth navigation (Phase 1, fixed)
- Redirect logic was only in `app/index.tsx`, which mounts only at `/`. After OTP
  verify the user was deep in `(auth)/verify-otp`, so the session updated but
  nothing redirected → stuck on verify screen. Fixed by adding a global **AuthGate**
  guard in `app/_layout.tsx` that watches `session` + `useSegments()` and
  `router.replace()`s to `/(tabs)` (signed in) or `/(auth)` (signed out). This also
  protects the tabs when signed out. Confirmed: OTP → Home, and session persists.

### Supabase auth notes (Phase 1, working)
- Phone provider ON; **test OTP** configured: `919986692684=123456` (country code,
  no `+`). Test OTPs valid until **July 30, 2026**. Twilio is entered but real SMS
  is NOT relied upon for testing — matched test numbers bypass Twilio.
- Migration `003_fix_referral_code_schema.sql` fixed a 500 "Database error saving
  new user": the referral trigger used pgcrypto `gen_random_bytes` (in the
  `extensions` schema, off the trigger search_path) → switched to core
  `gen_random_uuid`. All three migrations (001, 002, 003) are applied.

---

## 15. Phase 7 — Report PDF Design Spec (decided)

Two paid PDF reports: **Vastu (₹149)** and **Matchmaking (₹199)**. Design decisions
made with the user — build to these when Phase 7 starts.

**Visual style — "Premium & minimal" (on-brand, §12):**
- Deep indigo pages (`#14122b`→`#1e1b45`), gold accents (`#d9a441`/`#e6c063`),
  off-white text (`#f0ece8`).
- Elegant **serif** headings, generous whitespace, subtle gold line dividers.
- Understated and expensive-feeling. NOT ornate/mandala-heavy, NOT infographic-style.

**Length:** Medium — **~6–9 pages**.

**Required structure (every report):**
1. **Branded cover page** — ✦ Ritham logo, report title, person's name + birth details.
2. **Details page (up front)** — the person's full birth details + Kundli summary
   (Lagna, Moon sign, Sun sign, Nakshatra, key planetary placements). *(user-requested)*
3. **Birth chart diagram** — a rendered visual Kundli (North vs South Indian style: ASK
   the user when building).
4. **Main analysis** — report body (Vastu: directional / room-by-room; Matchmaking:
   compatibility / guna milan, doshas).
5. **Summary + score/verdict** — at-a-glance box (Vastu health score / compatibility %).
6. **Remedies & recommendations** — gemstones, mantras, directions, do's & don'ts.

**Generation approach (recommended):** HTML/CSS → PDF **server-side** (Edge Function) for
full control of the brand aesthetic. Report text narrated by Claude from Kundli facts
(rule #2: AI narrates, never computes). Cache each generated PDF in **Supabase Storage** —
one purchase = one stored PDF (protect margins, rule #4). Delivery: in-app viewer +
download/share. Gate behind verified payment (Phase 4 entitlements).

---

## 16. Phase 4 — Payments + entitlements (CODE DONE, deploy + test pending)

The full money layer is coded. It mirrors the Phase 3 pattern: all charging and all
entitlement grants happen server-side in Edge Functions; the client only opens the
Razorpay sheet and reports the signed result back for verification.

**Decisions locked (with the user):**
- **Native Razorpay SDK** (`react-native-razorpay`), not WebView — best UPI UX.
- **Both pack kinds** sold from day one via a **Questions | Time toggle** in the paywall.
- **Test keys ready** — server returns `key_id` to the client; `key_secret` stays a secret.

**What was built:**
- Migration `006_phase4_payments.sql` — `payment_orders` (order audit) + `entitlements_ledger`
  (one row per verified grant, rule #7) + RLS (clients read own; writes via service role).
- Edge Function `create-order` — recomputes the amount from server-side pricing (rule #3),
  enforces first-purchase-only (Bindu), creates the Razorpay order, records it `created`.
- Edge Function `verify-payment` — HMAC-SHA256 signature check; on match flips the order to
  `paid` and inserts the ledger grant. Idempotent via `unique(order_id)`.
- `chat/index.ts` — once the free minute is used, starts a **paid_time** session (whole
  time pack → countdown) or a **paid_questions** session (one question charged per reply).
  Returns `needs_purchase` / `out_of_questions` for the client to open the paywall.
- Client: `lib/paymentService.ts` (`purchasePack`, `getBalance`), `components/Paywall.tsx`
  (toggle + pack grid + Razorpay flow), wired into `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` (balance pills,
  paywall on exhaustion). `types/react-native-razorpay.d.ts` supplies the missing types.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.

### To go live (operational — must be done in the Supabase & Razorpay dashboards)
1. **Migration:** run `supabase/migrations/006_phase4_payments.sql` in the SQL editor.
2. **Deploy functions** (dashboard "Via Editor", the reliable path here):
   - Deploy `create-order` and `verify-payment`. **Note the slugs Supabase assigns** — if
     they aren't literally `create-order`/`verify-payment`, update `CREATE_ORDER_FN` /
     `VERIFY_PAYMENT_FN` in `lib/paymentService.ts` (same gotcha as `bright-processor`).
   - **Redeploy `chat`** (`bright-processor`) — it now consumes entitlements.
3. **Secrets** (Edge Functions → Secrets): add `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
   (test keys). They're read by both payment functions.
4. **Rebuild the app:** `npx expo run:android` — the native Razorpay module needs a fresh
   native build (it won't work over a JS-only reload).

### On-device test checklist
- Use the free minute → let it expire → paywall appears.
- Buy **Darshan (15 Q)** with Razorpay **test UPI `success@razorpay`** → returns, "❓ 15 left",
  chat works, count drops per reply. Run it to 0 → `out_of_questions` → paywall → top up.
  ⚠️ Do NOT use test card `4111 1111 1111 1111` → Razorpay rejects it as an "international card"
  (international payments are off by default). Use **UPI `success@razorpay`** (or domestic card
  `5267 3181 8797 5449`, OTP `1111`). This is a Razorpay account setting, not a code bug.
- Buy **Kiran (5 min)** → countdown pill starts; on expiry → paywall.
- Cancel the Razorpay sheet → no charge, no grant, message text restored.
- Verify in DB: `payment_orders.status='paid'` and a matching `entitlements_ledger` row.
- Reset the free minute to re-test: `update public.users set free_minute_used_at = null where phone='<digits>';`

### Pricing note (updated this session)
Question packs are now **Bindu ₹9 · Panch ₹35 · Darshan ₹79 · Gyan ₹169 · Brahmanda ₹349**
(paise: 900/3500/7900/16900/34900). **Bindu is a normal pack now** — the first-purchase-only
restriction was removed (the guard code remains in `create-order` but is inert). Time/report
prices unchanged. Source of truth is `config/pricing.ts`; the server copy in `create-order`
must mirror it. **Any price change requires redeploying `create-order`** (the server computes
the charged amount) — the client alone only changes the displayed number.

### Dev-run gotcha that cost time (avoid next session)
The device showed the red "Unable to load script" screen for a long while. Root cause was NOT
the build — it was a **stale `debug_http_host` = `192.168.0.101:8081`** saved in the app's
SharedPreferences (`/data/data/com.ritham.app/shared_prefs/com.ritham.app_preferences.xml`),
an IP that doesn't exist. The PC's real LAN IP is **192.168.0.12**. Fixed by setting the host to
**`localhost:8081`** (loads over USB via `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`).
- To edit that pref: force-stop the app first (it rewrites the file on exit), then
  `cat prefs.xml | adb shell "run-as com.ritham.app sh -c 'cat > shared_prefs/com.ritham.app_preferences.xml'"`.
- Windows Firewall blocks inbound 8081 for the LAN route and needs an **admin** rule to open
  (`New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Expo Metro 8081" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8081`).
  USB/localhost avoids all of it — prefer it.
- **Wireless ADB** (run cable-free): plug in USB, then `adb tcpip 5555` → `adb connect <phone-ip>:5555`
  → `adb -s <phone-ip>:5555 reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`, then unplug. ⚠️ The phone's Wi-Fi IP is
  **DHCP and changes** (seen: .10 → .4 on SSID `ACT_Aayush`) — get the current one with
  `adb shell ip -o -4 addr show wlan0`. If the link goes `offline` (phone slept / IP changed),
  replug briefly and redo the tcpip→connect→reverse sequence with the new IP.

### Not yet done (follow-ups for Phase 4 polish)
- No "restore/refresh balance" pull-to-refresh; balance loads on chat mount + after buys.
- Razorpay **webhook** (server-to-server `payment.captured`) not added — verify-on-return is
  enough for v1, but a webhook would catch app-killed-mid-payment cases. Add before launch.
- The Store/Reports tabs still don't surface packs; paywall lives only in chat for now.

---

## 17. Phase 5 — Home horoscopes (CODE DONE, deploy + test pending)

Free daily/weekly/monthly horoscopes on the Home tab, anchored to the user's Moon sign
(Rashi). Follows the chat pattern: text is generated only in an Edge Function, and
cached hard to protect margins.

**What was built:**
- Migration `007_phase5_horoscopes.sql` — `horoscopes` cache table, unique on
  `(sign, period, period_key)`, RLS (any signed-in user reads; only service role writes).
- Edge Function `horoscope` — resolves the user's `moon_sign`, computes the IST period
  bucket, returns the cached row or generates via Claude (mock until `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`),
  then stores it. **Shared per sign** — 12 signs × 3 periods max per bucket, not per user.
- `lib/horoscopeService.ts` (`getHoroscope(profileId, period)`).
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — Home rebuilt: greeting + "🌙 Moon in <sign>", Daily/Weekly/
  Monthly toggle, per-period cache, loading/retry states, `need_kundli` fallback.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.

**Design decisions:** see DECISIONS.md → Phase 5. Horoscopes are FREE and sign-level
(not personalised to the full chart — that stays the paid chat/report layer).

### To go live
1. **Migration:** run `007_phase5_horoscopes.sql` in the SQL editor.
2. **Deploy** the `horoscope` Edge Function (dashboard "Via Editor"). **Note the slug** —
   if it isn't literally `horoscope`, update `HOROSCOPE_FUNCTION` in `lib/horoscopeService.ts`
   (same `bright-processor` gotcha). **No app rebuild** — the client change is JS-only and
   loads on reload.
3. No new secrets. It reuses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (still unset → mock horoscope, which is
   fine for dev, same policy as chat: add the real key near launch).

### On-device test
- Open Home → header shows "🌙 Moon in <your sign>" → a horoscope renders (mock preview text).
- Switch Daily / Weekly / Monthly → each loads once and caches; switching back is instant.
- DB check: `select sign, period, period_key from public.horoscopes order by created_at desc;`
  — one row per sign+period+bucket; a second user with the same sign should NOT add a row
  (cache hit). Bucket keys are IST (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-Www`, `YYYY-MM`).

### Not yet done (Phase 5 follow-ups)
- No pull-to-refresh; horoscopes load on mount and cache in component state for the session.
- No scheduled pre-warm — first reader of a sign/period each bucket pays the generation
  latency. Fine for launch; a cron pre-warm could be added later.
